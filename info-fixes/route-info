Two ways to loadup route from package
1) route file to point return view('vendor/LogTailer/welcome'
   vendor/package name folder under resource/view

2)   use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
trait Test {

    public static function Init()
    {
        Route::get('/test', function(){
            return view('vendor/LogTailer/welcome');
        //  die('Route works from package! namespace Mikromike\LogTailer');
        });

Which route will be called by using Facades\Route.
